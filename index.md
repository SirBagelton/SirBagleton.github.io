### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 - My favorite lab was lab 9 part 2 because I got to learn how to parse through two strings and compare if they shared the same characters at the same indexes. This was fun because string comparisons seemed so confusing until I learned that they act similarly to vectors in that you can simply .at() a string variable to compare indexes.
* Lab 4 - My second favorite lab las lab 4 part 1 because I figured out you could call functions inside of other functions and sequentially have them read out each others returns to calculate their own individual values. This lab was interesting because calculating a value by using a series of functions seemed so confusing at first but making it work was very satisfying. The end goal was having a program which converted any number ML into teaspoons, tablespoons, cups etc. I may end up using this program in the future just for fun as well.
* Lab 6 - My third favorite lab was lab 6 part 1 because we made a sandwich using the arguments that we typed in after calling the program. It was fun seeing the sandwich be made of whatever arguments we typed into the terminal.
