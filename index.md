### CPSC 120

* Lab 9 - My favorite lab was lab 9 part 2 because I got to learn how to parse through two strings and compare if they shared the same characters at the same indexes
* Lab 4 - My second favorite lab las lab 4 part 1 because I figured out you could call functions inside of other functions and sequentially have them read out each others returns to calculate their own values.
* Lab 6 - My third favorite lab was lab 6 part 1 because we made a sandwich using the arguments that we typed in after calling the program. It was fun seeing the sandwich be made of whatever we typed in.
